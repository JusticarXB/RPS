*******************RULE THE PLAYGROUND SCHOOLYARD(RPS)***************
************************IRRESPONSIBLE ARMCHAIR***********************

Summary: On a nondescript schoolyard in the middle of nowhere, you, a new transfer student has arrived, and this is your first day on the playground. Many kids are playing this new game RPS(Rule The Playground Schoolyard), a mix of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and a Turn Based Rpg. You roam around the playground challenging children to play against you, as you seek to become the "Prince of the Playground."

Rules: The game is split into two different sections: the overworld where the PC can walk around and interact with NPC's. Then there is the RPG fight's which takes place after the player has challenged an NPC. There the PC then selects (With the enter key) attacks from a selection of 3 attacks, and then both the opponent and PC reveal which attack they have selected and damage is appropriately distributed according to the chart at the bottom of this page.

-In the overworld the PC moves around using the arrow keys and interacts wih NPC's with the "E" key

-Attacks can be changed in the pause menu after you have started a new game, by first pressing esc, to enter the pause menu, then selecting the character option and finally the styles menu.

-Attacks are progressively unlocked by challenging more NPC's, until there are none left or you defeat the "Prince of the Playground."

- Once the prince has been defeated the game ends and the number of losses and damage dealt and taken will be displayed representing a sort of personal score.
